# Tight Binding program to compute the band structure of simple semiconductors.
Parameters taken from Vogl, Hjalmarson and Dow, [A Semiempirical Tight-Binding Theory of the Electronic Structure of Semiconductors](http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0022369783900641), J. Phys. Chem. Sol. 44 (5), pp 365-378 (1983).

Usage exampes in the ipython notebook.

There are also some very old code that I wrote a long time ago based on some work by Walt Harrison and by Chadi and Cohen that I uploaded here in case it interests anyone.
